# mydocker

## Why 
This project is for this book.
https://book.douban.com/subject/27082348/

I write about 80% functions of the whole book and add some updates when running in Ubuntu.

## How to read the code
The folder “code” is for mydocker. Other folders are demo code for showing some key background knowledge.
For instance, ufs forlder is the demo code how to use ufs in golang. If you don't know the basic background things,
I suggest to read these codes and actually run it in your OperatingSystem.

Thanks for reading the project.
